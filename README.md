## DKFP Software

### dkv

The DKIM Verifier utility. dkv is a Perl script for validating DKIM signatures
in a corpus of emails, and supports user-supplied key caches. This is
particularly useful for validating messages against known keys that have since
changed.

### DKFP

The DKFP website will eventually be managed under this github project. This
will include tools and scripts used to enable the functionality of the site.
